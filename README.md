# DOM Manipulation Practice

This repository contains practice exercises related to DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation. The exercises cover different aspects of DOM manipulation such as working with selectors, creating elements, navigating through the DOM, working with events, and forms. All exercises are written in JavaScript without modifying the HTML. These exercises were done as part of my study at BeCode.
